Clarence Wee is a product designer who likes to tinker with tech stuff. If anything does not look right on the site, he must have broken something, again.
Aside from breaking stuff, he likes photography, cycling, snowboarding, hiking and cooking. When no one else is looking, he sings and plays on his guitar.

His design portfolio can be found at [clarencewee.design](https://clarencewee.design)
